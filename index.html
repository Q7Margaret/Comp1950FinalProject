            <h2>Introduction:</h2>

            <p>Welcome to the client site of TeamOne – a team of bright and motivated students sharing the COMP 1950 experience.  This site provides information about the TeamOne members, the team’s methodology in completing the term project and outlines a rationale for several proposed changes to the existing COMP 1950 website (thenet.ca/1950).  Links are also provided here to a proto-site and blog, which give the visitor a clear sense of the team’s vision for a new and improved COMP 1950 website.</p>

            <h2> Team Members</h2>

            <h2>Methodology</h2>
            
            <p>The first step in the project was for the entire team to participate in brainstorming ideas for improving the existing site.  This involved reviewing the questionnaire answers which were provided by Alistair, discussing the purpose(s) of the website, and identifying items for improvement.  The team was also motivated by Alistair’s remarks in class that this project was an opportunity to “bring it all together”, i.e. to showcase all of the skills that we had learned during COMP 1950.  Out of this process came a vision for a new site, outlined in the following section.</p>
            
            <p>The project manager, Rod, divided the project into smaller tasks, for which teams of two volunteered to take responsibility.  A Git repository was used to keep track of code development.  Specific tasks and responsibilities were as follows:</p>

            <ul><li>(content from Rod)</li></ul>



            <h2>Bringing It Together</h2>
            <p>As mentioned previously, it was important to TeamOne that their work on this project showcase the skills they have learned by taking COMP1950.  The following list outlines how and where these skills have been employed:</p>

            <ul>
            <li>Open proto-site in a new window. target="_blank" not supported in HTML 5, so us javascript?</li>
            <li>file/folder names all lowercase, no spaces, etc (week 1)</li>
            <li>semantic markup (week 2) separate code from style, logical styles</li>
            <li>SEO: use distinct titles, meta descriptions, etc (week 3)</li>
            <li>use HTML5 elements appropriately (week 3)</li>
            <li>CSS: two media for assignment - screen and print (week 4, week 5), proper use of selectors, etc. CSS should validate correctly.</li>
            <li>CSS: use a reset (normalize?).(week 5)</li>
            <li>CSS: media queries: (week 5) Not sure if we want to do this, or have separate css files for each media</li>
            <li>SSI: use SSI to include common code in proto-site: header(s) footer, navigation (week 6)</li>
            <li>CMS/Templates: we are using Github for code-control, and the Blog example from Tumblr (week 7, week 8)</li>
            <li>Methodology: client site has a page to discuss rationale, related to methodology (week 9)</li>
            </ul>
